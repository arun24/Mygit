--branch gives isolation to your tasks, you can think of branch as a workspace(floder) containing changes or commits.
--Every repository by default comes with master(main branch).
--We should not directly work on master, we have to create temporary branch for every separate tasks/bugs, 
  After code is reviewed then  we have to integrate with main branch.
--In real life you will not have access to write to master branch.

--All ways we can pull latest code from Mater it is beter.
  and create new branch and work on new branch for tasks/bugs
